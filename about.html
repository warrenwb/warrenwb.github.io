BACKGROUND
<br/>
Alex grew up on a farm in Harrogate, North Yorkshire where as well as helping out with the animals, she drove diggers, went rock climbing, rode horses and loved the great outdoors. Keen on a challenge she even completed the Duke of Edinburgh Award.
She attended a very traditional all girls boarding school and although rebelled a little, excelled in all things creative including A-level art and design.
Coming from a line of known inventors and engineers as well as explorter Captin Cook, antiques and engineering is also part of her heritage.

With a first-class honours degree in Film & TV with Journalism, Alex quickly got her first break in TV and moved to London the next day to start her television career. Since then she has worked her way up the ladder as Line Producer/Production Executive on shows for the likes of BBC, Ch4 and Nat Geo, working for companies such as Endemol, Talkback Thames and Jamie Oliver's Fresh One. Her experience working in production has been invaluable for directors working with her as a presenter.

				<br/>
                        	<br/>
Not one to shy away from a challenge, Alex has also worked as an actor on various broadcast programmes such as Mafia Killers (Reelz USA) and commercials such as Flora. But it was following her modelling career and working in retail where her passion for fashion began. This lead to her presenting both in the UK and abroad working as a reporter at London Fashion Week and fashion advisor on the live TV programme  QVC (Sky 650). She was also stylist for the brand La Redoute, and in her spare time blogged about the latest trends and both hosted and produced her own online menswear TV show MNSWR.TV.

				<br/>
                        	<br/>

With programme ideas up her sleeve, Alex is now looking to do more factual and factual/entertainment based TV presenting.
